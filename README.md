How to automate Facebook Ad Research with AI?

I’ve just built a fully automated Facebook Ad Research System using the no-code platform n8n, with Apify to scrape ad data and OpenAI and Google Gemini as the AI models. The system automatically scrapes, analyzes, and rewrites top-performing Facebook ads using AI.

This isn’t just a scraper.
It’s an end-to-end AI research assistant for advertisers.

✅ What it does:
→ Searches Facebook’s Ad Library via Apify, filtering for high-performing campaigns
 → Categorizes ads into Video, Image, or Text formats
 → Processes content with OpenAI (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o) and Google Gemini API for deep analysis
 → Generates rewritten ad versions using AI
 → Stores everything in Google Sheets for easy access
 → Uses Google Drive for file handling (video uploads, prompts)
 → Runs scalable loops for bulk analysis — hundreds of ads at once

⚙️ Built For:
• Advertising Agencies → competitor monitoring & creative inspiration
• E-commerce Brands → extract and adapt ad formulas from top brands
• Marketers & Strategists → test “parasite campaigns” based on proven ads
• Product Teams → research messaging across different industries
